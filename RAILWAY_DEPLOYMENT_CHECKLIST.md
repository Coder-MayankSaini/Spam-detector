- **Backend**: https://your-app.railway.app  
- **Database**: Managed by Railway (PostgreSQL)

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

### Free Tier (Good for testing/demos)
- Railway: $0/month (with usage limits)
- Vercel: $0/month (hobby use)
- **Total**: $0/month

### Production Tier
- Railway: ~$5-20/month (backend + database)
- Vercel: $0/month (still free for most apps)
- **Total**: ~$5-20/month

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails on Railway**:
   - Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
   - Verify Python version in runtime.txt

2. **Database connection errors**:
   - Railway automatically provides DATABASE_URL
   - Don't manually set database connection

3. **CORS errors**:
   - Ensure CORS_ORIGINS includes your Vercel URL
   - Update after frontend deployment

4. **Email not working**:
   - Verify Gmail app password
   - Check email environment variables
